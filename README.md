# Distance calculator

This is an app that using the Google Maps API, calculates the distance travelled from a starting point. It will show you the route taken on the map along with the distance travelled on that route.

To run this project locally on Android, place your Google Maps API Key in `/android/local.properties` as shown:

```bash
googleMaps.apiKey=***
```
